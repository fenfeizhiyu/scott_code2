Interface of methods to get/set socket options. This interface is implemented by: SocketImpl and DatagramSocketImpl. Subclasses of these should override the methods of this interface in order to support their own options.
The methods and constants which specify options in this interface are for implementation only. If you're not subclassing SocketImpl or DatagramSocketImpl, you won't use these directly. There are type-safe methods to get/set each of these options in Socket, ServerSocket,
 DatagramSocket and MulticastSocket.
