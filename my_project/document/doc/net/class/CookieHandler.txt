extends Object
A CookieHandler object provides a callback mechanism to hook up a HTTP state management policy implementation into the HTTP protocol handler. The HTTP state management mechanism specifies a way to create a stateful session with HTTP requests and responses.
A system-wide CookieHandler that to used by the HTTP protocol handler can be registered by doing a CookieHandler.setDefault(CookieHandler). The currently registered CookieHandler can be retrieved by calling CookieHandler.getDefault(). For more information on HTTP state management, see RFC 2965: HTTP State Management Mechanism
